***
Designed & taught by Machine Learning practitioners from the industry, students will not only be equipped with **requisite understanding of machine learning (ML) concepts**, but also be exposed to cutting-edge ML techniques such as **Ensemble Learning and Recommender Systems**.

The course culminates in an exciting **Kaggle-styled Machine Learning prediction competition**, where students compete to build the best model for prizes and bragging rights!
***
### Learning Outcomes:
AI200 will augment the technical skills students have acquired in AI100. From this course, students will learn to:
- be comfortable merging & transforming real-world datasets for feature engineering,
- develop interactive graphical visualisations,
- grasp the intuition & differences across supervised & unsupervised machine learning algorithms,
- train & evaluate machine learning models for classification, regression and clustering problems, and
- build their own recommender systems using collaborative filtering.
